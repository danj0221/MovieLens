HarvardX PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone (MovieLens Project Submission)

The purpose of this project on Movie rating predictions will be compared to the true ratings in the final_holdout_test set using RMSE.  This project is related to the MovieLens Project of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course. The present report begins by providing a general overview of the project and describing its objectives. The given dataset is then prepared and set up for analysis. An exploratory data analysis is conducted to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of predicting movie ratings. The process involves refining the model until a final version is achieved. The results are explained in detail. Finally, the report concludes with some insightful remarks.
